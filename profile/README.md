# Harshil Makhija 
Computer Science Student | Analytical Backend Developer & ML Engineer |

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Iâ€™m Harshil relentless problemâ€‘solver and innovation junkie on a mission to architect scalable backend systems and build cuttingâ€‘edge AI/ML solutions. I thrive on endâ€‘toâ€‘end ownership: from spinning up Docker containers to orchestrating distributed pipelines and designing intelligent agents that learn and adapt.

## About Me
-  **Current Focus**  
   - Backend Development (Python, FastAPI, C++)  
   - AI/ML Engineering (PyTorch, LangChain, RAGâ€‘based agents)  
   - Cloud & DevOps (Docker, CI/CD, AWS fundamentals)

- **Core Tech Stack**  
  - **Languages:** Python, C++, JavaScript
  - **Frameworks & Tools:** FastAPI, PyTorch, LangChain, Docker, Git/GitHub Actions  
  - **Cloud & Infra:** Docker Compose, AWS (EC2, S3 basics), Linux CLI, bash scripting  

-  **Key Projects & Initiatives**  
  1. **AIâ€‘Powered RAG System**  
     - Built browserâ€‘automation pipelines for realâ€‘time data retrieval and contextual retrievalâ€‘augmented generation agents.  
     - Integrated custom embeddings and fineâ€‘tuned LLMs for domainâ€‘specific query resolution.  
  2. **Deep Learning Model Training App**  
     - Endâ€‘toâ€‘end prototype using PyTorch + FastAPI REST endpoints to launch training jobs and monitor metrics.  
  3. **Generative Annotation Tool**  
     - Leveraged vision models to autoâ€‘annotate images/videos, cutting labeling time by 50%.  
  4. **Chatbot with Live Internet Access**  
     - Designed a conversational agent using LangChain + custom RAG logic for upâ€‘toâ€‘theâ€‘minute knowledge.
