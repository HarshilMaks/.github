# Harshil Makhija  
**Machine Learning Practitioner & Backend Systems Engineer**

I work at the convergence of **AI systems, backend engineering, and cloud infrastructure**, building practical, scalable solutions that move from idea to deployed product.  
My work spans LLM agents and RAG architectures to high-performance APIs that reliably serve ML models in production.

My approach is straightforward: design clean systems, ship iteratively, and scale with intent. Everything I build is rooted in engineering fundamentals and guided by a product-focused mindset.

## Professional Ethos

I enjoy building systems end-to-end: architecting services, developing ML workflows, and deploying everything through cloud-native pipelines. So my main focus remains consistent across projects:

- **Reliability:** Systems that hold up under real usage  
- **Scalability:** Infrastructure that grows without friction  
- **Maintainability:** Clear, modular, testable code  
- **Performance:** Faster inference, optimised retrieval, efficient design  
- **Impact:** Practical solutions powered by modern AI

Whether it's a microservice architecture or a vector-search pipeline, I aim for clarity, robustness, and long-term maintainability.
